        <p><strong>PART ONE: HAVING FAITH IN GRAND DREAMS.</strong> Understanding the <em>why</em> of the work is the most important thing thatâ€™s needed when starting out. Itâ€™s so easy to become discouraged when youâ€™re in the the thick of the weeds, when you need to do difficult or tedious. Motivation and discipline to do such work comes from having a bigger pictureâ€Šâ€”â€Ša purpose.</p>

<p>This purpose comes from a place of realistic optimism and idealism. Itâ€™s a messy and bold goal. A tangible, yet implausible objective without conventional measure or perspective. Thereâ€™s a lot wrong with the worldâ€Šâ€”â€Šand a lot of people that will complain about itâ€Šâ€”â€Šbut how can you improve it? What troubles are you willing to tackle head-on for the good of humanity?</p>

<h2 id="how-to-effectively-go-about-doing-whats-truly-important">How to effectively go about doing whatâ€™s truly important.</h2>

<!--more-->

<p>Itâ€™s a lot to ask, to a point where most people donâ€™t even push themselves to even attempt it. And those that <em>do</em> attempt to achieve something grand usually stop after failing only once or twice.</p>

<p>The reason so few people succeed in capturing the essence of a heartfelt purpose is a lack of faith. Having the faith in yourself that youâ€™re truly capable of accomplishing that goal, no matter the obstacles, or opinions, or failures that you will inevitably face. It takes a fair amount of foolishness to ever succeed in accomplishing audacious.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t back out of a goal as soon as it looks like itâ€™s going to failâ€Šâ€”â€Šhave more trust than doubt. Many people discuss the learning opportunities that reside in failure, but the truth of the matter is that gritting your teeth and persevering and eventually finding success is a far more enriching learning experience.</p>

<p>It is important to understand the context of where you currently stand in history. Research your contemporaries that have similar goalsâ€Šâ€”â€Šespecially if theyâ€™re currently doing far better than you are. Research the great thinkers and creators of the past, as well. Having this contextual model will not lead you to achievement, but will guide you in the right direction, like a compass.</p>

<p>At the same time, you must not be rigid with your objectives, either. Do not let pride get in your wayâ€Šâ€”â€Šredirect your efforts if you need too. Being agile is far more intelligent than abandoning your efforts altogether and starting from square one.</p>

<p><strong>PART TWO: ELIMINATING EVERYTHING NON-ESSENTIAL.</strong> Simply understanding what you want to accomplish will not allow you to actually get it done. The <em>what</em> of work is doing the technical and nitty-gritty, which is the contrary of the initial motivating and lofty goals.</p>

<p>They both outstandingly require one another. Being only an idealist thinker wonâ€™t get anything done. While being only a busy-bee worker wonâ€™t get anything <em>meaningful</em> done.</p>

<p>It doesnâ€™t matter if you are clueless when youâ€™re first beginningâ€Šâ€”â€Šthatâ€™s normal. Mastery of any knowledge or skill requires only deliberate practice and enough time. Be humble enough to absorb the knowledge of everybody around you. Learn to constantly ask critical questions. Be resourceful with the amount of information you can find both locally and <a href="https://medium.com/@brennanbrown/guide-to-self-learning-7ea651650d11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online</a>.</p>

<p>Figure out priorities, examine what work needs to be done as opposed to whatâ€™s just easy and non-essential filler. The next part is vital: look at your schedule and block out large chunks of time (four to seven hours) where you <em>just work</em> on whatâ€™s most important.</p>

<p>You cannot allow yourself to be interrupted by others, or distract yourself with the plethora of attention-grabbing media thatâ€™s currently at our disposal. This can be extremely difficult at first, but donâ€™t be afraid to communicate with others that youâ€™re busy with something and that youâ€™ll talk to them later.</p>

<p>Similarly, push yourself to sticking to one tab or application open at a time. Stop yourself from constantly jump from one inquiry to another. Be mindful of how youâ€™re using technologyâ€Šâ€”â€Štake a break every once in awhile.</p>

<p>A lot of people say they simply donâ€™t have the time in their schedules to devote themselves so deeply to something. But the truth of the matter is that even if you have other responsibilities, you can fit this work into your calendar by understanding and eliminating the time youâ€™re currently wastingâ€Šâ€”â€Šbecause we all waste time.</p>

<p><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br />
I believe weâ€™re all given the opportunity to achieve goodness in the world thatâ€™s beyond ourselvesâ€Šâ€”â€Šwhether itâ€™s in small ways or big ways. Weâ€™re all born being good at somethingâ€Šâ€”â€Štechnical or creativeâ€Šâ€”â€Šand with an intense curiosity of the world we live in.</p>

<p>It is far too easy to veer off the path of pioneering, to instead be comfortable with letting life pass us by. I believe that we can make the conscious decision to change thatâ€Šâ€”â€Šat any point in our livesâ€Šâ€”â€Šand instead <a href="https://medium.com/@brennanbrown/our-finite-everything-8ed4d9d70a2f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aspire to greatness</a>. All it takes is a little courage, and a lot of reckless abandon.</p>
