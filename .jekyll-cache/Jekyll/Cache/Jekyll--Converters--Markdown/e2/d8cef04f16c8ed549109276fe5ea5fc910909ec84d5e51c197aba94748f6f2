Point being you and your circumstances are completely unique[[Warren Buffet talks about the idea of maintaining an inner score card of principles to escape this girardian mimetic rat-race::rmn]]. Also, James Richardon, the poet, says this beautifully in his book â€œVectors: Aphorisms and 10 Second Essaysâ€:</p>

  <p>â€œHe wants to know what the best is so he can be superior to everything at once by seeing that the best isnâ€™t perfectâ€.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One way to handle this would be to realize the fragility of the epistemic confidence acquired as a result of accomplishment based superiority. Socio-cultural structure like Humility can help with this a lot. It is to be noted that , and not the false pretension to decieve each other into playing the comparison and pseudo-superiority game, which would just defeat the purpose of seeing the uniqueness of circumstance.</p>
