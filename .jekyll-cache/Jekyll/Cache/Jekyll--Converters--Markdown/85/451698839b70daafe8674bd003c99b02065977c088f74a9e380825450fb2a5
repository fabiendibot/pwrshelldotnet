I"Ÿ<p>Another busy bee week! Time seems to be flying by for me. On the forums, I was given the <em>Regular</em> badge, meaning I can change thread titles, such as â€œBrennanâ€™s Beeminder Journal 2020â€ to â€œBrennanâ€™s Beeminder Journalâ€, which allows this Beejournal to continue ad infinitum, huzzah!</p>

<p>Regarding <em>/morning-pages</em>, the solution I found was to use <a href="https://help.beeminder.com/article/88-urlminder"><strong>URLminder</strong></a>, this will track the word count of (multiple) Google Docs or Dropbox documents. I figure Iâ€™ll add a new document each month, as I find thatâ€™s a good time-frame to segment writing. And unlike Draft, URLminder lets you change the deadline time, which was my entire problem in the first place. The caveat being that Iâ€™ll need to adjust to writing somewhere else consistently.</p>

<p>This weekâ€™s verbal contract will be: To get a better at understanding API. Although Iâ€™ve found multiple new systems within the unofficial integration lists that Iâ€™m excited to use, it made me realize how much more potential there isâ€“and perhaps the frustration that 3rd party solutions seem so ephemeral. <a href="https://github.com/Khan/khan-api/blob/master/README.md">Khan Academy</a>, for instance, have deprecated their API entirely. <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/open-api">FreeCodeCamp</a> hasnâ€™t had theirs updated in nearly two years. Is interest in this kind of things just too niche?</p>

<p>On the other hand, I think thereâ€™s benefit in there only being thirty or so high-quality official integrations. I know when I first was starting out, I didnâ€™t feel overwhelmed by the paradox of choice.</p>

<p>As Iâ€™ve written about a few weeks ago, limitation breeds creativity for me. Itâ€™s been fun trying to work with just the official integrations, but this would not be an experiment of self-improvement if stagnation was allowed! Exciting things are going on, Iâ€™m trying a bunch of new stuff.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/clozemaster"><strong>/ClozeMaster:</strong></a> Supplement my French learning with Duolingo</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/meditation"><strong>/Meditation:</strong></a> Itâ€™s so cool how you can use Apple Health to track mindful minutes with different meditation apps. Iâ€™m still have to figure out my favorite but right now Iâ€™m using Headspace.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/prayer"><strong>/Prayer:</strong></a> Using Rosarium (<a href="https://blog.beeminder.com/rosary/">Beeminderâ€™s blog post about it</a>), my relationship with spirituality is <em>complicated</em>, but I definitely enjoy the Rosary prayer, and itâ€™s a good way to start my days with the right intentions.</li>
</ul>

<p>P.S. I figured out why RescueTime was still measuring time even though I was AFK. It has to do with a pesky <a href="https://www.unixreich.com/blog/2013/linux-nvidia-optimus-on-thinkpad-w520w530-with-external-monitor-finally-solved/">design flaw</a> (<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_W520#Nvidia_Optimus_Setup">more detail</a>) of the ThinkPad W520 (which, by the way, is the best laptop ever minus this one thing).</p>

<p>P.S.S. Also added a link to @narthurâ€™s <a href="https://www.nathanarthur.com/beeminder-wiki/">beewiki</a> to <a href="https://journal.bar">journal.bar</a>, I hope it catches on! ğŸ˜Š</p>
