I"‹<p>Quite a red-letter day for my neighbours south of the border. I would be lying if I said I wasnâ€™t anxious for tonight, so I better finish this weekly review as early as possible :^)</p>

<p>First off, my apologies for this post not being very Beeminder-specific, Iâ€™ve been getting dedicated with my development work with Jekyll the past week. So I havenâ€™t really given the time needed to examine how my Beeminder goals have been affecting things in my life, like I usually (neurotically) do. Iâ€™m planning to do a full review of my now 24(!) systems.</p>

<p>Some bad news and good news: The bad news is that I definitely bit off more than I can chew with trying to modify Simply Jekyll. It already had a 1,300 line CSS file, and I decided it would be a good idea to add Bootstrap on top of that, and although I love how it looks and what itâ€™s capable of, itâ€™s hopelessly bloated.</p>

<p>The good news is that I successfully completed <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/"><strong>Hacktoberfest</strong></a> for the first time! But even better, I went back to the drawing board and created my first open-source project for others: <a href="https://github.com/brennanbrown/watery"><strong>Watery</strong></a>, which is the most minimal yet functional Jekyll theme I could create. I went down the rabbit hole of <a href="https://github.com/dbohdan/classless-css">classless CSS frameworks</a> and used the most popular one, Water.css, for this.</p>

<p>I also just added a neat feature on the <a href="https://watery.netlify.app"><strong>demo site</strong></a> that lets you effortlessly see how it would look using a different classless CSS framework instead, which really demonstrates its extensibility.</p>

<p>To tie it back to relevancy, I am probably going to use a variant of this theme for my Beeminder blog <a href="https://journal.bar/">journal.bar</a>. Speaking of, Iâ€™ve been thinking more down-the-line about this experiment, and trying to figure out if there would be any meaningful way to measure difference from the beginning to, say, a year after. I can offer my own laymanâ€™s observations, but itâ€™d be neat to be an academic guinea pig.</p>
