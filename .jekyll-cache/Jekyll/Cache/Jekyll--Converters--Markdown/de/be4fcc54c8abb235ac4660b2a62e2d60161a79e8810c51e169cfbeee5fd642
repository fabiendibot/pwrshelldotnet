I"­<p>Not really as busy with Beeminder this week! Iâ€™ve mostly been really busy with my new Jekyll digital garden project (which you can preview <a href="https://enjoymentwork.netlify.app">here</a> if youâ€™re curious). Itâ€™s crazy how many useful rabbit holes Iâ€™ve gone down in research, and with the serendipitous benefit of having the projectâ€™s purpose be to archive and organize such rabbit holes!</p>

<p>Anyways, sticking with Beeminder, Iâ€™ve noticed that <strong>/meditation</strong> seems a little selective with which â€œmindful minutesâ€ it adds as data pointsâ€“if itâ€™s a new medtiation from Headspace I havenâ€™t done before then itâ€™s added, but if itâ€™s one that Iâ€™ve already done then it doesnâ€™t seem to count it. Iâ€™ve noticed the iOS application updated though, so maybe it was just an anomaly.</p>

<p>Also, I think the reason things were weird with URLminder reading from Google Docs was simply because I didnâ€™t set the privacy settings for the document correctly, whoops. Seems to be working now! I know itâ€™s been forever since I initially started with this goalâ€“and I havenâ€™t really needed it since Iâ€™ve started a devlog on Draft that I plan to migrateâ€“but I think itâ€™s still worth finally implementing correctly.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been fumbling hard with <strong>/distraction</strong> lately. Iâ€™ve been derailing due to incorrect labeling of different websites Iâ€™ve been visiting, and it doesnâ€™t update like other systems do, to the point where itâ€™s 11:50 and itâ€™s still orange because it hasnâ€™t updated (and I know I shouldnâ€™t be in front of a screen that late, but thatâ€™s another issue that needs to be tackled), which is a problem since itâ€™s a do-less goal.</p>

<p>The simple solution to this is to just visit the RescueTime dashboard one per evening to make sure that the obscure sites Iâ€™m visiting are correctly labelled and that Iâ€™m not going over my unproductive screen-time limit.</p>
