I"ê<p>Here is the new home of PwrShell.net for now.
After a long time without blogging and sharing my findings, starting from scratch with a nice hosting sound like a good idea.</p>

<p>As usual, you‚Äôll find writtings about kubernetes, Azure or PowerShell (not in that particular order :) ) you may also read posts about sports (trail or running)</p>

<p>See you soon, space cowboy !</p>

<p>Bye.</p>
