        <p>Cultural additions like oneâ€™s philosophical inclinations, directed social interactions through common social artefacts, etc can add personal touch to the essays,which not only elevates the engagement but also the life expectancy of an essay. Take any essay by Orwell from [[As I Please::https://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/As_I_Please/english/]] during his time in The Tribune, or his other [[essays::https://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/index_en]].</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Apart from the quirky and chirpy attitude, what makes this this [[Application to New Yorker for a Job::https://fs.blog/2014/05/eudora-welty-to-the-new-yorker-the-best-job-application-ever/]] by Eudora Welty so memorable in my opinion is her use of common social artefacts like subtle mention of her background and its significance in how it relates to her being in this position right now;</p>

<blockquote class="boxit serif small-medium">
  <p>â€¦I am 23 years old, six weeks on the loose in N.Y. However, I was a New Yorker for a whole year in 1930â€“ 31 while attending advertising classes in Columbiaâ€™s School of Business. Actually I am a southerner, from Mississippi, the nationâ€™s most backward state. Ramifications include Walter H. Page, who, unluckily for me, is no longer connected with Doubleday-Page, which is no longer Doubleday-Page, even. I have a B.A. (â€™ 29) from the University of Wisconsin, where I majored in English without a care in the world. For the last eighteen months I was languishing in my own office in a radio station in Jackson, Miss., writing continuities, dramas, mule feed advertisements, santa claus talks, and life insurance playlets; now I have given that upâ€¦.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The witty use of what I like to call a socio-cultural confabulation in the form of a movie review and a relatable but madeup word that is also original in a sense.</p>

<blockquote class="boxit serif small-medium">
  <p>â€¦As to what I might do for youâ€” I have seen an untoward amount of picture galleries and 15Â¢ movies lately, and could review them with my old prosperous detachment, I think; in fact, I recently coined a general word for Matisseâ€™s pictures after seeing his latest at the Marie Harriman: concubineapple. That shows you how my mind worksâ€”quick, and away from the point. I read simply voraciously, and can drum up an opinion afterwardsâ€¦</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mention of India print and subtle showcase of how she knows the struggles in the industry without any explicit mention.</p>

<blockquote class="boxit serif small-medium">
  <p>â€¦Since I have bought an India print, and a large number of phonograph records from a Mr. Nussbaum who picks them up, and a Cezanne Bathers one inch long (that shows you I read e. e. cummings I hope), I am anxious to have an apartment, not to mention a small portable phonograph. How I would like to work for you! A little paragraph each morningâ€” a little paragraph each night, if you canâ€™t hire me from daylight to dark, although I would work like a slave. I can also draw like Mr. Thurber, in case he goes off the deep end. I have studied flower paintingâ€¦</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the final invocation of the extremely common social contruct i.e., <strong><em>the leprechaun throw.</em></strong></p>

<blockquote class="boxit serif small-medium">
  <p>There is no telling where I may apply, if you turn me down; I realize this will not phase you, but consider my other alternative: the U of N.C. offers for $12.00 to let me dance in Vachel Lindsayâ€™s Congo. I congo on. I rest my case, repeating that I am a hard worker.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This may not have been the best application in a formal sense, but the reason people go to it is probably because what it reminds them of â€” the cultural nostalgia (the shared social artefact).</p>

<p>Another type of common artefact is sincere immitation of great works, the sincere admiration can help with the remembrance. Related: [[Sincere imitation is authentic]]</p>

<h3 id="addendum">Addendum</h3>

<p>Incorporation of common artefacts might also help with remebering and understanding it easily when you read them years later. To put it succintly, it help you [[Write so your future self can remember]]</p>
