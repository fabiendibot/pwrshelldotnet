I"J<p>Alright, letâ€™s get into the weeds this week (or perhaps flowers?). Overall, I think Iâ€™ve found a good equilibrium with Beeminder. I donâ€™t often derail, but at the same time I have over a dozen beemergencies every single day.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also really happy for the spread of systems I have, finding ways to track my mental health, physical health, hobbies, and both creative and technical projects.</p>

<p>Regarding French, Iâ€™ve been stuck in the Emerald league forever in <strong>/duolingo</strong>, but progressing down the tree nonetheless. <strong>/clozemaster</strong> is definitely a welcomed addition, as the lessons are a lot quicker and give a more nuanced look at how words are actually used.</p>

<p>Since I began tracking <strong>/writing</strong> in May, Iâ€™ve written over 100,000 words, which is crazy to me. Although a good portion is just private journal writing, Iâ€™m still happy Iâ€™m doing it everyday. Before, Iâ€™d really try to win NaNoWriMo every year (anybody participating, btw?) and always fall short because I never wrote &gt;1,500 words a day otherwise. I suppose Iâ€™d rather write ~400 words a day indefinitely than risk pushing and burning myself out.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m still finding a bug (or maybe feature) where <strong>/meditation</strong> doesnâ€™t add data if youâ€™re repeating a guided meditation. Iâ€™ve switched over to doing simple timed meditation with <a href="https://insighttimer.com/">Insight Timer</a> and that seems to work instead!</p>

<p>I recently derailed on <strong>/fitness</strong> by just a couple hundred steps, which initially seemed silly. But in reality, I have to remind myself that whatever Iâ€™m tracking on Beeminder is the <em>bare-minimum</em> threshold, and I gotta pass it everyday no matter what.</p>

<p>One thing Iâ€™ve noticed that I talked about on the Beeminder Discord (which you should <a href="https://discord.gg/Bw8FdB5shW">join!</a>) is that all my systems ultimately fall within two categories: input-based vs. output-based.</p>

<p>Now, when I originally began with Beeminder many years ago, I had the rhetoric that you should aim for looking at input rather that output. Which I still believe is betterâ€“but why not both if thatâ€™s an option?</p>

<p>There are a few examples of this: <strong>/writing</strong> is the input, and other goals like <strong>/blogging</strong> or <strong>/poetry</strong> are output. (A caveat being that writing is fortunately easy to both quantify and automate.)</p>

<p>Output-based goals that Iâ€™ve been having the most trouble with are the ones that I havenâ€™t really found a good input-based supplementary goal to add to it. I do really well with beemergencys pushing me towards doing work, but output goals donâ€™t have a daily metric, theyâ€™re usually weekly or monthly.</p>

<p>I finally had the brilliant idea to use RescueTime and track the amount of time that Iâ€™m specifically on Lynda each day to supplement <strong>/courses</strong>. I had a few good ideas for tracking pages read or time with <strong>/books</strong>, but I often get weasel-y if the data isnâ€™t automated. ðŸ˜… So itâ€™d be nice to figure out a way to connect with Kindle or Audible.</p>

<p>(P.S. Working on a new Jekyll theme this week, <a href="https://github.com/brennanbrown/purelog">Purelog</a>!)</p>

<p>(P.S.S. Anybody doing NaNoWriMo this year? Using Beeminder to track it?)</p>
