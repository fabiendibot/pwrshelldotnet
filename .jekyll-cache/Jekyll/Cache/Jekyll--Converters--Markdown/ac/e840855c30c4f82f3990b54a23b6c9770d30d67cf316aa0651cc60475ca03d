I"4<p>Another busy bee week! Time seems to be flying by for me. On the forums, I was given the <em>Regular</em> badge, meaning I can change thread titles, such as “Brennan’s Beeminder Journal 2020” to “Brennan’s Beeminder Journal”, which allows this Beejournal to continue ad infinitum, huzzah!</p>
