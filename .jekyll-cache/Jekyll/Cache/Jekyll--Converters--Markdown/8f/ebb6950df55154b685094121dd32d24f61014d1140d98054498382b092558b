I"<p>A rather busy week for me, bee-wise. I’ve been spending more time on the forums and getting more into the weeds of things, which has been fun!</p>

<p>I realize now, at this point, I have ±10 beemergencies a day. This is by design, as it pushes me to actually get my daily tasks done.</p>

<p>It doesn’t really work for bigger tasks I have, like blog posts, where sometimes I try to just create something the last day instead of utilizing the whole week for it. I’m not really sure how to intelligently segment something like writing an article in a way that fits into how I use Beeminder.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/distraction"><strong>/distraction:</strong></a> Cleaned up the graph’s jagged ups-and-downs in the road editor. I also changed the rules on RescueTime to be more strict with what’s considered distracting so I waste less time on the computer.</li>
  <li>In general, I changed the views of a few older goals that I created back in 2017 to see their full range, rather than just when I restarted them. (Eg. <a href="https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/productivity">/productivity</a> and <a href="https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/french">/french</a>. I hope this increased context helps provide better understanding. Similarly, I’ve made data points public where applicable.</li>
  <li>I also <em>still</em> need to find a new solution to <a href="https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/morning-pages">/morning-pages</a>, and this is my verbal contract to myself I’ll have that corrected before next week’s post.</li>
</ul>

<p>I finally took a gander at <a href="https://beemind.me">beemind.me</a> for new ideas, and I’ll be going over the integrations megalist (now that I know it exists, hah) this week to see what else I can add.</p>

<p>My rule of thumb for new systems is this, I’ll add it to my already large list of beemindings if I find a way to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Automatically track what I already to.</li>
  <li>Automatically track something I really want to start doing.</li>
  <li>Automatically track something that’s fun and takes less than five minutes (see /typing).</li>
  <li>Or, manually tracking something I <em>need</em> to start doing.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="new-systems">New Systems</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/meta"><strong>/meta:</strong></a> I’ve been trying to figure out what my meta goal should be for awhile, and I think tracking the daily cumulative data points from my other systems fits. It’s definitely more interesting/fun than helpful right now, but why not?</li>
  <li><a href="https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/typing"><strong>/typing:</strong></a> I love typing games, and have been using <a href="https://www.keyhero.com/profile/brennanbrown">KeyHero</a> forever, so why not give TypeRacer a try! Only problem is that it isn’t working. :( No matter what I do, I get a “Could not fetch scores.” for the value. I don’t know if it’s worth making a dedicated thread for?</li>
</ul>
