I"š<p>Not really as busy with Beeminder this week! Iâ€™ve mostly been really busy with my new Jekyll digital garden project (which you can preview <a href="https://enjoymentwork.netlify.app">here</a> if youâ€™re curious). Itâ€™s crazy how many useful rabbit holes Iâ€™ve gone down in research, and with the serendipitous benefit of having the projectâ€™s purpose be to archive and organize such rabbit holes!</p>
